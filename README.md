TICTACTOE Game
Welcome to the TICTACTOE game! 🎮 The classic 3x3 grid game where two players alternate placing their marks (either 'X' or 'O') on the board to try and get three in a row. It's simple, fun, and a perfect way to pass the time!
<br>
🚀 Features
Two-player gameplay: Play with a friend and challenge each other.
Interactive Grid: Visualize the board in real-time as you make your moves.
Auto-win detection: The game checks for a winner after every move!
Reset and Replay: After a game is over, reset the board and start fresh.
🎮 How to Play
Clone the Repository:
<br>
bash
Copy code
<b>
git clone https://github.com/The-Animesh-Pathak/TicTacToe.git
Run the Game: Launch the game by opening the game file in your browser or run it on your local machine depending on the language used.

Start Playing:

The game will display an empty 3x3 grid.
Player 1 will always be 'X', and Player 2 will be 'O'.
Players take turns placing their marks on the grid by selecting an empty spot.
The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all spots are filled without a winner, the game will end in a draw.
Restart: Once the game ends (either with a win or draw), the game will ask you to restart to play again.

💡 Code Explanation
How the game works:
Board Setup: A 3x3 grid is initialized. This grid is represented as a 2D array.
Turn Logic: The game keeps track of whose turn it is. Players alternate placing 'X' and 'O'.
Winner Check: After each move, the game checks if there's a winner by looking for a line of three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Game Over: Once a winner is found, or all the spaces are filled, the game ends. A message is displayed announcing the result.
Restart Option: Once the game concludes, a button appears to restart the game.
